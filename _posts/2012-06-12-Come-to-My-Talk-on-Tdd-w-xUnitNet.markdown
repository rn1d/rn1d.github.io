I will be presenting at the .NET User Group of Latvia on the topics of unit testing, test driven development and the xUnit.net unit testing framework. Details on the event can be found at the [User Group homepage][1], and on the Latvian Developers Network [LinkedIn page][2].

The presentation will include a mix of Test Driven Development and xUnit.net topics, including:

1. What is xUnit.net
* The motivation behind xUnit.net
* How it compares to other popular unit testing frameworks
* Lessons learned from nUnit
2. Basic xUnit.net usage, Visual Studio workflow integration
3. Introduction to Test Driven Development
* Red-Green-Refactor cycle
* Unit testing principles
4. Advanced xUnit.net features.  


I will be presenting after my colleague Dace Zari≈Üa, who will be giving a talk about QUnit - a JavaScript unit testing framework. It promises to be a great oppertunity to learn more about unit testing. Please come along - it should be good fun!
